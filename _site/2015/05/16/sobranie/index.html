  <p>When I was 19 and a <em>college man</em> (even then, an outdated expression), I took it into my head to smoke a pipe. Not, as some, but not many, of my coursetemporaries were smoking, as a crucible for <em>Cannibus sativa,</em> but for its <strong>truly</strong> addictive distant cousin, <em>Nicotiana tabacum.</em></p>

<p>After a period of trial and error, I learned, to the dismay of my roommates, of the inverse relationship between <em>room note</em> and actual taste. Thus, I left behind the aromatic blends that smelled like vanilla insense and moved on to the more manly blends, that smelled something like burning tires but had a robust, smooth taste that I could enjoy all day without becoming satiated.</p>

<p>My first station was a blend still made, albeit with Cypriot, rather than true, Syrian, Latakia.</p>

<p>It was perhaps more refined than my palette, for I soon gravitated to a deeper, mellower blend</p>

<p>That in turn was but a waystation before I turned to the blend that would carry me through my appointed score years of smoking</p>

<p>This produced a smoke that was almost chewy, like a single-malt scotch. It was my many pipe a day companion until the time came that I entered a smoke free setting just when my self diected promise to give up the habit came due. Since that day, when Bless√®d St. Ronald is said to have been working miracles, my chimney has been cold, save for the occasional cigar during the Clinton years.</p>
