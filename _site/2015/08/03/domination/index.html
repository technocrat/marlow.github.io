  <p>Six police officers couldn’t get a mentally ill prisoner to bend her knees, so she could be placed in a transfer chair. So, they shocked the 5’3”, 130 pound black woman four times and stopped her heart, following which, presumably, they achieved compliance with their lawful order.</p>

<p>As reported in <a href="http://wapo.st/1gG8LMz">WaPo</a>, this is just the outcome to be expected in applying 50,000 volts to a severely agitated person or giving anyone four applications.</p>

<p>Stanley Milgram would not be surprised that people who are given permission to apply force past any point of persuasion would not hesitate to keep cranking the dial. The officers could not break her will, so they broke her heart, literally.</p>

<p>This represents another problematic aspect of standard police doctrine, which is the application of non-lethal force to attain voluntary compliance of a subject. Most people choose to surrender rather than endure increasing amounts of pain. For that portion of those to be subdued, it is certainly preferable to the use of deadly force. (Doctrine is also shoot-to-kill, not disable.)</p>

<p>But another portion of those to be subdued have no will to overcome, because they are permanently or temporarily cut-off from their rationality due to chronic mental illness or to the effects of drugs. No amount of pain will suffice to bring these to submission. They must be physically disabled. A low-tech way to do this, in use for over 2,000 years, is to entangle the subject in a net. A bolo can also be effective.</p>

<p>An appropriate control tactic to the situation, however, is hindered by the Universal Hammer approach of continuing to apply the same method, in this case using a Taser, hoping that it will work this time.</p>

<p>You would think that two officers holding a small subject’s shoulders, one sitting on her lap, two strapping in her legs and one in reserve would have been a preferable approach. You have to wonder if the method that was used had its origins more in punishing defiance.</p>
