  <blockquote>
  <p>I came in with a healthy skepticism about these programs,” Mr. Obama said. “My team evaluated them. We scrubbed them thoroughly. We actually expanded some of the oversight, increased some of the safeguards. But my assessment and my team’s assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks. And the modest encroachments on the privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration without a name attached and not looking at content, that on net, it was worth us doing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>President Obama, quoted in <a href="http://nyti.ms/1G6zhYB">NYT</a></p>

<p>Oversight, safeguards and compliance measures do not deter true believers on a devine mission any more than they deter traders.  The Freedom Act (newspeak term) does nothing more than allow the President and his state security apparatus (polite term for the secret police) to claim that formerly they were stretching a law that did not permit free roving warrants, they are now stretching one that does.</p>
