    <blockquote>
  <p>But this, too, was a minor threat. Langone was simply threatening to withhold money. Now, as the pope prepares a major encyclical on climate change, to be released this summer, the billionaires are spending a great deal of their money in a direct assault on him. They are calling in their chits, their kept scientists, their rigged conferences, their sycophantic beneficiaries, their bought publicists to discredit words of the pope that have not even been issued: “He would do his flock and the world a disservice by putting his moral authority behind the United Nations’ unscientific agenda on the climate,” they say. They do not know exactly what the pope is going to say in his forthcoming encyclical on preserving God’s creation, but they know what he will not say. He will not deny that the poor suffer from actions that despoil the earth. Everything he has said and done so far shows that Francis always stands for the poor.</p>

    <p>Marlow has been blogging going on a score years, first on an SGI Indy and a fractional T-1, then a virtual server. Such tedious overhead. Aristophenes be damned! Onto the cloud!</p>

    <p>I have no quarrel with time.<br />
I float, flow, will sink, not sync.<br />
Time herself has the indifference<br />
Of a schoolboy’s secret crush,<br />
We stand invisible in suspense<br />
That perhaps the usual rules<br />
Will be suspended, in our case,<br />
And the surprise will be more time,<br />
Time long after we weary of it<br />
As we wearied of childhood and<br />
Its fabled happiness of endless<br />
August cut off from recess.</p>
