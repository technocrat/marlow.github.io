        Memories of tastes past

    <p>When I was 19 and a <em>college man</em> (even then, an outdated expression), I took it into my head to smoke a pipe. Not, as some, but not many, of my coursetemporaries were smoking, as a crucible for <em>Cannibus sativa,</em> but for its <strong>truly</strong> addictive distant cousin, <em>Nicotiana tabacum.</em></p>

<p>After a period of trial and error, I learned, to the dismay of my roommates, of the inverse relationship between <em>room note</em> and actual taste. Thus, I left behind the aromatic blends that smelled like vanilla insense and moved on to the more manly blends, that smelled something like burning tires but had a robust, smooth taste that I could enjoy all day without becoming satiated.</p>

<p>My first station was a blend still made, albeit with Cypriot, rather than true, Syrian, Latakia.</p>

<p><img src="https://careaga.s3.amazonaws.com/2015-05-16-raparee.jpg" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>It was perhaps more refined than my palette, for I soon gravitated to a deeper, mellower blend</p>

<p><img src="https://careaga.s3.amazonaws.com/2015-05-16-black-mallory.jpg" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>That in turn was but a waystation before I turned to the blend that would carry me through my appointed score years of smoking</p>

<p><img src="https://careaga.s3.amazonaws.com/2015-05-16-sobranie.jpg" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>This produced a smoke that was almost chewy, like a single-malt scotch. It was my many pipe a day companion until the time came that I entered a smoke free setting just when my self diected promise to give up the habit came due. Since that day, when Blessèd St. Ronald is said to have been working miracles, my chimney has been cold, save for the occasional cigar during the Clinton years.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Congress, of course, has been known to do nothing. Rampant game-theorizing joined with senatorial incompetence may mean that June 1st will come and nothing will be done. If there is one thing that the Senate is adept at, it’s missing deadlines. This is a hard one to hide from, though, even for these legislators. We’re used to asking whether Congress matters; in this case, the question here is whether Congress’s laws matter, either. If they don’t, we’re not left with much in Washington but a wrecking ball.</p>

    <p>John Kenneth Galbraith was within a letter of being right</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The disappearance of jobs has not ushered in a new age of leisure, as social theorists predicted uneasily in the 1950s. Would the masses utilize their freedom from labor in productive ways, such as civic participation and the arts, or would they die of boredom in their ranch houses? Somehow, it was usually assumed, they would still manage to eat</p>

    <p>I have been dabbling in the hipster lanaguage Lua, which you have to be cool even to have heard about. Its claim to fame is minimalism. It has one data type, called a table and I found myself wanting to combine two or more of them à la cat (concatenate). WTF, there is no built-in way to do this? Incredulity began to lift when I discovered that neither was there a built-in way to even print tables. As a public service for the benefit of other pilgrims, here is</p>

<pre><code>   --cat.lua concatenate tables
    function cat( ... ) -- append 1D tables
        local List = require 'pl.List' -- penlight library
        local args = {...}
        local l = List()
        for i=1, #args do
            l:extend(args[i])
        end
        return l
    end
    --[[Example
    a = {
        "gala",
        "cameo",
        "jazz"
    }
    o = {
        "seville",
        "valencia",
        "navel"
    }
    g = {
        "concord",
        "thompson",
        "muscat"
    }
    f = cat(a,o,g)
    {gala,cameo,jazz,seville,valencia,navel,concord,thompson,muscat}
    --]]

  <p>This is obviously a problem for the Bush camp, but it’s a big one for the nation’s army of concerned citizens, too.
