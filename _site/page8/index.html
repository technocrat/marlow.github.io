    <p>Very functional</p>

<pre><code>-- combo.hs
-- problem: C(k,n), where k = the integers from 1 to 9, inclusive
-- and n = 3, without regard to order, then sum the subsets
import Data.List
combinations 0 lst = [[]]
combinations n lst = do
    (x:xs) &lt;- tails lst
    rest &lt;- combinations (n-1) xs
    return $ x : rest
result = ( map sum (combinations 3 [1..9]))
</code></pre>

<p>Python alternative</p>

<pre><code>import itertools
result = map(sum, itertools.combinations([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], 3))
for i in result: print(i)
</code></pre>

  <p>What was really lethal was the interaction between size and complexity. Financial institutions had become chimeras: part bank, part hedge fund, part insurance company, and so on. This complexity let them evade regulation, yet be rescued from the consequences when their bets went bad. And bankers’ ability to have it both ways helped set America up for disaster.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>The nature of reality that spills forth from Einstein’s physics is so much more startling than the simplistic, undergraduate-beloved shibboleth: everything is relative to subjective points of view. In Einstein’s physics, there is no passage of time, no unidirectional flow from the fixed past and toward the uncertain future. The temporal component of space-time is as static as its spatial components; physical time is as still as physical space. It is all laid out, the whole spread of events, in the tenseless four-dimensional space-time manifold.</p>

  <p>Everyone who operates in the public world and gets mail knows that a small percentage of the American population is completely out of its mind. It’s always been that way. The founding fathers probably received letters from people who believed King George was living in a barn down the road and spying on the local militia while disguised as a burro. The difference now, of course, is that the Internet and social media make them a lot more visible and noisy.</p>
