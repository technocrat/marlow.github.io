    <blockquote>
  <p>Far from marking the “end of imperialism”, what we are witnessing today, a century after the implosion of the Ottoman empire, is its resurgence. In this new scramble for the Middle East, we are witnessing the petty sultans of the region’s crumbling states trying to hold on to their micro-empires; non-state armed groups trying to usurp them; Iran and the emerging powers of the Gulf seeking to expand their spheres of influence; and the US’ long-standing hegemony being challenged by the new-old kid on the block, Russia, and newcomer China.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>So numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes which serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we, upon many occasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right side of questions of the first magnitude to society. This circumstance, if duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any controversy.</p>

    <p>Lying in bed with aching joints and a fever,</p>

<p>wracking up plugs of phlegm,</p>

<p>the patient suffers the annual spring chest cold</p>

<p>As the voice descends to the lower register,</p>

<p>so does the normal awareness of time, </p>

<p>like Einstein’s traveler</p>

<p>Whatever it was, last week or next, will have to wait</p>

<p>The faint cares of taxes and insurance pass through brief notice</p>

<p>Vague ambition to re-read, again, the page of the open book</p>

<p>arises and likewise fades</p>

  <p>I say to the cast, “Henry didn’t know he was going to have six wives. Each time he thought, here’s the girl for me.” People smile, but they grasp the essential thing. The characters don’t know their own fates. They can’t learn a lesson from themselves, and draw a moral. We have scripts, but they don’t. They are trapped in 50 years of improvisation, called life.</p>

    <p><em>Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?</em></p>

<p>Ecclesiastes 1:10</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m glad for my songs to be honored like this. But you know, they didn’t get here by themselves. It’s been a long road and it’s taken a lot of doing. These songs of mine, they’re like mystery stories, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they’re on the fringes now. And they sound like they’ve been on the hard ground.</p>

<p>Over the course of 25 centuries, between the Preacher and the Mystery Tramp, a long skein of wisdom has always had it that novelty is superficial, the human condition is unchanging and meaning is ever uncertain.</p>

<p>Were we ever to see something truly new instead of merely different, we would neither recognize nor comprehend it. An alien comes to Earth. It wanders around seeing nothing it recognizes as like anything it knew. And it wanders invisibly down city streets, through suburban malls and along country roads, impinging on our senses but unregistered by our minds.</p>

<p>There is no punchline without a setup.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>These days, political scientists, evolutionary biologists, and even government regulators are obliged to grasp best-response equilibria and other aspects of game theory. Whenever a government agency is considering a new rule—a set of capital requirements for banks, say, or an environmental regulation—one of the first questions it needs to ask is whether obeying the rules leads to a Nash equilibrium. If it doesn’t, the new policy measure is likely to prove a failure, because those affected will seek a way around it.</p>

  <p>This violent contradiction between the data of experience, from which he could not liberate himself, and which, of course, all his life he knew alone to be real, and his deeply metaphysical belief in the existence of a system to which they must belong, whether they appear to do so or not, this conflict between instinctive judgement and theoretical conviction – between his gifts and his opinions – mirrors the unresolved conflict between the reality of the moral life, with its sense of responsibility, joys, sorrows, sense of guilt and sense of achievement – all of which is nevertheless illusion – and the laws which govern everything, although we cannot know more than a negligible portion of them – so that all scientists and historians who say that they do know them and are guided by them are lying and deceiving – but which nevertheless alone are real.</p>

  <p>Doing his utmost, deploying all his energy, a young man setting out from zero can wind up after ten years somewhere below where he started. Today, talent needs the kind of luck that favors the incompetent; in fact, if a skilled man rejects the vile arrangements that bring success to rampant mediocrity, he will never get on at all.</p>
