What can you say about a man who waited to abandon citizenship of the nation of his birth far into adulthood only when it became politically convenient? (Left as an exercise to the reader.)

By all accounts, Ted Cruz is a gifted appellate lawyer, well versed in constitutional argument and analysis. I have no doubt that he would be able to argue either side of the question of whether the son of an American mother and a Cuban father is eligible to be President as *native born citizen* notwithstanding that the son was born in Canada.

As a member in good standing of the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States he would be candid with the Court; this *would* be a case of first impression, not a matter long settled.

Depending on his client, and how things stood, he could take one of three approches:

* Argue that this is a political question from which the Court should abstain and permit the Electoral College, for example, to make the determination
* Argue that although the term is undefined in the Constitution, the Congress *is* given the exclusive power to define citizenship and naturalization and the Court should look to how the legislative evolution of these terms and the ways in which they have been interpreted by the courts should be used to find the **contemporary** meaning of the natural born clause.
* Argue for **original intent**: at the date the Constitution was adopted, how would the Founders and *We, the People* have understood the phrase?

The prospects of the Court declining to address the issue as a *political question* are not as good as they might have been prior to the 2000 Election. Having tasted the power of appointment of a President, a repeat opportunity may be institutionally difficult to pass up.

With respect to the second argument, the Court has often shown its willingness to adapt the language of the Constitution to the day and age in which we now live. Among many examples, may be cited the reduction of the first clause of the Second Amendment as mere surplusage. We now live in a time when a *well regulated militia* has no relation to the prohibition against the infringement of the right of the people to bear arms. This type of elastic approach is called *judicial activism* when the result is disfavored and *a living Constitution* when it is favored.

For the final argument, Ted must argue that the term *natural born citizen* was so well understood as to need no explanation at the time. Under British law has it had been applied in England and the Colonies, from time out of mind, citizenship was confered automatically by birth in the realm, subject only to a few exceptions not relevant here. Since 1350, an alternative route of citizenship *at birth* was also available in some circumstances, all of which had in common that the child born abroad must have at least a **father** who was a citizen. If the mother was also a citizen, so much the better, but she needn't be. However, a child born to a citizen mother abroad by a non-citizen father, was not a citizen either by birth or at birth and could only hope to achieve citizenship through one of the processes of naturalization. While the rights of native and naturalized citizens are similar, they are not identical. In particular, the naturalized citizen cannot become President or Vice President.

There are subtle theologians and there are unsubtle fundamentalists -- what is *really* meant by this passage *vs.* there can be *no doubt* whatsoever that this passage means exactly what it says. So, as well, there are Constitutional scholars, advocates and jurists who see the Constitution as the source of principles and those who see it as inalterable writ.

Ted may be selling himself as a rock ribbed Republican who considers the Old and New Testaments and the Constitution the single unalterable word of God almighty himself. But it's hard to imagine him embracing the archaic view that who one's father was is more politically significant than who his mother was. Although undecided, in law school we would say that the *better view* is that the citizenship of a child born of one or both US citizens outside the country has the same status as a child born *in* the United States regardless of the citizenship of his or her parents. 

But no one, not even his friend (who declines to be identified) ever accused Ted of being authentic.
