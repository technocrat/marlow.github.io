*Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?*

Ecclesiastes 1:10

> I’m glad for my songs to be honored like this. But you know, they didn’t get here by themselves. It’s been a long road and it’s taken a lot of doing. These songs of mine, they’re like mystery stories, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they’re on the fringes now. And they sound like they’ve been on the hard ground.

Over the course of 25 centuries, between the Preacher and the Mystery Tramp, a long skein of wisdom has always had it that novelty is superficial, the human condition is unchanging and meaning is ever uncertain.

Were we ever to see something truly new instead of merely different, we would neither recognize nor comprehend it. An alien comes to Earth. It wanders around seeing nothing it recognizes as like anything it knew. And it wanders invisibly down city streets, through suburban malls and along country roads, impinging on our senses but unregistered by our minds.

There is no punchline without a setup.
