title: Daycare Costs and Unexamined Assumptions
tags: politics, reporting

The rise of data journalism has not been accompanied by a rise in thoughtful analysis. I saw this again the other day from [Vox] and I was annoyed by using a map just to show percentages (why not a table?) and then began noticing other problems.

First, the costs come from a source that gives separate estimates for an infant and a four-year old at day-care centers and the article-lite doesn't say which it used to calculate the percentages of median income that costs represent. Worse, it uses median *household* income, when data for *families* is available.

Second, it does not stratify the data by race. There are differences, large differences, between the cost profiles for everyone and for individual classifications.

The following series of maps divides costs into high, medium and low percentages of family income for each of the following groups: all races, non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, African American, Asian American and Native American. The percentages are based on the reported costs of infant day care in a day care center as a portion of *median* ***family*** income.

Let's start with a similar all-in presentation to the one that [Vox] used.

This shows a group of expensive states, colored dark blue, in the Pacific states and Nevada, Colorado and Kansas, the Upper Midwest, North Carolina and most of the urban Northeast states. (Omitted, due to scale, is the District of Columbia, which is even more expensive.) This group has costs ranging from about 15.7% to 21% of median family income.

The intermediate group, colored a lighter blue, includes Montana and Wyoming, most of the remainder of the Midwest, plus the Southwest, Texas, Oklahoma and Florida, plus Connecticut and the rural New England states. This group has costs ranging from about 13.4% to 15.7% of median family income.

The remaining group, colored lightest blue, of states with the daycare costs that consume the least proportion of family income includes most of the South, Idaho and Utah, the Dakotas and New Jersey. This group has costs ranging from about 10% to 13.4% of median family income.

So far, this only addresses my first set of criticisms. I've shown the mapped data more appropriately and I've specified the data used in the calculations. But what about the second criticism, blindness that not all communities have similar median family incomes?

Here is what the situation looks from the perspective of white, non-Hispanic families.

The most-intermediate-least expensive states follow a similar patterns with a few shifts. **But in each case the buckets are lower.** The most expensive states only require up to about 18% of median (white, non-Hispanic) family income, compared to about 21% for all families. The intermediate states are similar and the least expensive states require as little as about 8.4% of median family income, compared to about 10% for all families.

The situation for Asian American families is similar to that of white, non-Hispanic families.

The big difference is that the most expensive states are up to about 22% of median (Asian-American) family income, compared to about 18% for white, non-Hispanic. There are some differences in which states are the least or most expensive.

For Hispanic, African-American and Native American families, the pictures are quite different.

Each of these groups are divided into similar collections of states in the three categories. And the **least** expensive category for each requires the same proportion of median family income as the **most** expensive categories for white, non-Hispanic and Asian-American families. The **most** expensive category for each group requires *twice* the percentage of median family income, up to 45%. 

It's important to keep sight of the limitations of the data and the ways in which ratios interact. Consider a family moving from an intermediate cost state to a higher cost state. *Only* if its income does not rise will its day-care expense ratio worsen. These maps, then, show the interaction between costs in each state and incomes in each state, which can move in synch or not.

Also, it is unrealistic to expect that minority families in these three groups are spending nearly half their pre-tax[^ss] income on child care. The cost data are averages, and within each state there are more expensive day care centers and less expensive day care centers. We can assume that minority families use the least expensive centers or resort to home-based day care to bring costs within manageability.

To the extent that costs of care in centers reflect quality of care, the result might be facilities that are less safe, staffed by less experienced or less well trained staff in those centers within the means of those families than at the market average cost facilities. *All other things being equal,* children receiving care in low-cost centers should be expected to have poorer outcomes than their contemporaries at market-average facilities. To the extent that those early childhood experiences have later effects on childhood development they are unlikely to be positive. This can only be thought of as another potential contributor to the **cycle of poverty.**

We shouldn't think of day care merely as a place to store children during business hours any more than we should think that way of schools. Children are people, too, my friend. Like corporations they lack the vote and the proportion of the electorate struggling to meet the costs of child care in any election cycle is probably not enough to swing results. In a political system of competing interest groups, minority children are among the least influential. 

[^ss]: Although families with lower incomes may escape income taxes, payroll taxes reduce the portion of family income available to pay daycare. As a result, the average costs in the most expensive states may represent closer to half of take-home pay.
