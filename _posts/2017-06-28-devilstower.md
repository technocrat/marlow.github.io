One of the justifiable gripes of the intracoastal population is the sneering reference to their home states as **flyover territory**, as if all they were consists of obstacles to the urban traveller.

Having labored to create a block of free time, I embarked as a Corps of Discovery of one to drive solo over a good chunk of it. I'll begin *in media res* with Sheriden, WY.

I left my hosts, the wonderful Swindell family (Bryan, Cam, Sawyer and Neva)

who welcomed me into their busy lives for a long weekend. Heartfelt thanks, again and over.

Before my trip I finished a [book], *The Heart of Everything That Is: The Untold Story of Red Cloud, An American Legend* that relates the mostly forgotten triumph of Native American arms against U.S. Army regular troops at Fort Kearny, just south of Sheriden on the Bozeman Trail.

As often happens when reading history, translating placenames to modern locations is very helpful, but we (I) are too lazy to do it. I was delighted to see signs just out of town directing me to the state park at the site of the action.

Also, when reading military history, I find myself imagining sites as far larger and at greater distances than they actually are. I forget that horses can only run up slopes that more resemble gentle hills than craggy peaks. Here I found a battlefield at strollable scale.

The early summer site of the winter battle looks innocuous enough, a pleasant stroll over a gentle hill. What happened there was the army's worst defeat until Custer's Last Ego, ten years later. A column of 81 men were sent out on a punitive raid against Sioux who had killed an officer the day before. None returned.

Red Cloud, the Sioux chief who orchestrated the total encirclement of the column, with overwhelming force, was not only a tactical genius, but a geopolitical and strategic genius as well. He organized the loosely affiliated Sioux in alliance with traditional enemies and neutrals to cut off American encroachment into the Powder River Basin. The victory on this little knoll was not the chance of a lucky break, it was set up far in advance.

Fascinating stuff.

I drove south and east on I-90 past Gillette, which my siblings dubbed Modor for its open pit coal mining and adjacent coal fired power plant. On that day, the lair of zoom seemed dormant, no steam spewing into the air (it was hot upper 80sºF). But the whole area was, well, messy. As if grownups had neglected to put away their toys for a century.

It was a relief to leave the interstate and head back north and east toward the edge of the Black Hills, whose rolling slopes are covered in a crown of pines with an open understory, making it look like a park designed to keep down ball sports and frisbees.

I was headed toward Devil's Tower and spotted it from 10 miles looking like a giant shark fin in a rough sea, sort of a mashup of *Jaws* and *Close Encounters of the Third Kind.* I didn't see any mashed potatoes, though (cinema injoke).

The hard rock sticks its thick thumb above the surrounding sandstone and shale.

After chatting up a geology grad high school teacher working a summer job as a ranger and buying some sunscreen, I set off to circumambulate the rock along the Red Rock Trail, so named because

It's about a 5 km walk. I went counter clockwise, losing about 500 feet in elevation and having closely to watch my feet from tripping (a contemporary cousin on my father's side loved to hike around Colorado Springs; he recently fell into a ravine on a hike and died). 

Besides the wonder of the rock itself, there were a few curiosities: boulders here and there that had fallen off the column and bounced hard enough to land several thousand feet away, what I call Picnic Rock (another injoke)

an overhang that looked like a leaping trout (ok, that's a stretch)

but I listened to Shubert in my head until the trail started the climb back to regain the lost elevation.

I got unadorned views in my 360º walk

or hike, rather. It's the first real trail hiking I've done in a very long time and I pegged the tach at 170 bpm before learning to watch the redline. Whenever my pulse (thank you, Apple Watch) got near 160 bpm, I'd stop until it got back down to 140 bpm. This slowed me down, of course, but I still finished in 90 minutes. Not bad for a fat old man.

Although I enjoyed the few flowers and sagebrush among the grass, I was disappointed by my failure to spot any wildlife. The National Park Gods must of heard my lament

because suddenly I developed a third for 100 proof sour mash whiskey after seeing a stately procession across the road out of the park.

By then I was feeling a little peckish and headed to the nearest town looking for a bite. Not promising, so I headed to Rapid City, skirting the Black Hills. You pass a lot of fresh baled hay, but see few cattle or horses. 

Before sundown, I was in Rapid City, back in T-Mobile land with no domestic data roaming restrictions (who knew?). I couldn't find a brew pub that sounded promising and settled for acceptable Mexican downtown, found a room at a generic chain and slept like Rip V. Winkle, but awoke afreshed and found this Starbucks in a mall for breakers and my usual quad iced espresso. 

Travelling without a set itinerary has its disadvantages (tour dates for the Minuteman missle silo are booked through July 20), but it removes a surpising amount of time-based anxiety. We'll see how this approach holds up after I see the Badlands and head off for KC and points south and west.
