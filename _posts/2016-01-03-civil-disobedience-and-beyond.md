Sit-ins as a civil disobedience protest have a long and mostly honorable history. Petitioning the government for redress of grievences can often go unheard, let alone unheeded. Civil disobedience is a way of getting a hearing.

The way it should work is all very ritualized. The protesters enter the governmental facility and refuse to leave. After due warning, the protestors are peaceably taken into custody by the police and, in due course, brought before a judge. Skipping over procedural steps that may be involved, the best practice is for the defendants to admit that their actions constitute a violation of the applicable low-level offense of an unauthorized use, or equivalent, the judge gives them a reasonable opportunity to air their underlying grieveneces through a spokesperson, the defendants waive a jury trial, the judge finds them guilty, imposes a sentence equal to pre-trial detention time served, perhaps a nominal fine, and puts them on probation, with notice that a repeat peformance leaves the realm of civil disobedience and becomes a real criminal matter.

Armed insurection, such as Harper's Ferry or Fort Sumpter, involves different procedures: basically "surrender or be attacked." If one does surrender, a criminal trial is a certainty and, upon conviction, severe penalties are likely. If one does not, on the other hand, surrender after an offer of parley, due process can become quite abbreviated. 

In the tradition of Robert McNamara, let's run the numbers. It costs about $30K per year per inmate in the federal system (https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/05/12/2014-10859/annual-determination-of-average-cost-of-incarceration). Neglecting the costs of prosecution (which are mainly allocated labor costs of assistant US attorneys and staff who would otherwise be prosecuting other crimes) and assuming a 20-year sentence, taking an insurrectionist into custody may result in a $600,000 imposition on the fisc. Assuming, further, that an insurrection attracts 100 or so enthusiasts, the $60,000,000 incareration cost would have to lead a prudent official to consider the costs of applying military force as an alternative to ordinary police action.

Assume the facility occupied has a replacement cost of, say $20 million, and hardware costs for munitions such as Hellfire missiles run around $75,000 per pop. Operator costs can be neglected. Drone operators are paid whether they have targets or not. 

As a consequence, in this type of situation, without putting any law enforcement lives at risk, destroying the facility and outbuildings and rebuilding them, and firing 100 drone-borne missiles has a cost of around $20 million plus habitat restoration costs, for which I have no estimate, a savings of $40 million over apprehension and incareration. Even if the kill rate were less than 100%, rapid attrition among the ideologically shallow should be expected. 

That would be the fiscally prudent method of resolving such a situation, should it ever eventuate.
