> Never mind if the obscenities were imagined—“Louie Louie” promised its listeners stronger stuff. As a member of the Flint Junior Woman’s Club argued, with admirable logic, in a 1965 letter to J. Edgar Hoover, it hardly mattered what the actual lyrics were when “every teenager in the country ‘heard’ the obscene not the copywritten [sic] lyric.”
