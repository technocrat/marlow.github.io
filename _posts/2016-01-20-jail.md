We begin life with release from protective custody
And we end with permanent incarceration, despite
Hopes of Resurrection of the Flesh and Life Everlasting

In between we may be held captive at home, kept against
Our will in the unremitting boredom of schooling, with
Our will in the isle of the lord of flies of work
Or fall, justly or no, into the crushing jaws of the law

All these losses of liberty, large, small, eyerolling,
Crushing, all arise from our deficits of power, for as
Hierarchical primates, for there to be winners, there
Must, of implacable necessity, be also losers. Which
We are in the local ladder of status and submission
Depends on fortune and misfortune, the implacable
Laws of unforgiving chance and our varied disposition
To seize the moment or to shun the seeming danger

Most of the time, however, we build walls to protect
Our tender, tenuous sense of self, the untenable 
Illusion that at our address someone is home, has 
Always lived there and always will, sovereign in our
No one like us uniqueness and our always been like that
As prisons go, the prisoner knows best how to lock away
The heart, mind, soul and growth otherwise flourishing
