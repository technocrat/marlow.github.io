Take a look at any map of the US and find the 100th meridien (longitude). If you don't have a detailed map, just look at any map of the US and draw a north/south line at the western end of Oklahoma.

To the west of that land is a semi-arid climate that's good for warm-weather grazing all the way to the Rockies, which has a different set of conditions. To feed livestock over the winter, you have to plant hay. To grow the hay (or most anything else) you need water. You can't get enough of it from rain (although there *are* some gully washers); you have to draw it from beneath the ground. Eastward, you can usually farm from rainfall, although some crops benefit from irrigation.

It's pretty easy to judge when you cross the line from dryland to traditional agriculture. You see more trees, fewer irrigation rigs, more hay rolls (old-fashioned hay bales now seem a relic), more field crops, bigger towns and a more varied landscape, in general.

Not that this is the transition from East of Eden back to the Garden; not that all is thriving prosperity.

Why this acerage has relatively new equipment growing weeds is a question with many possible answers, but the overarching answer is that here is land, and the means to farm it, that is fallow. Not for want of water, but for want of labor.

This is not a new phenomenon. The *American Family Farm* meme, the descendant of Thomas Jefferson's agrarian idea of the yeoman farmer, retains its hold on our imagination, even as the number of family owned and operated farms has been on a steady decline going back to the early part of the last century.

There are even vital urban centers, such as Omaha, with its broad avenues, vibrant civic institutions and manifest public investment in civic improvements. 

In all of the cities that I went through, including Omaha, Kansas City, MO, Springfield, MO, Oklahoma City, OK, Amarillo, TX, Las Cruces, NM and Tucson, AZ, there is the shared, national commercial culture of chains. It's even hard to tell the difference between one locally owned laundrymat in one state with another in a different state. All diners are set up pretty much identically. Although the proportions vary, you'll see all advertised brands of auto-mobility across the region west of the Mississippi. And, while you may notice more churches, some of them lined up like an auto row of the soul, the believer/non-believer controversies don't show up in billboards the way you might expect. Those seem to express themselves, like so much else, online.

I had a few hours after reaching Tucson to burn (it was **hot**) before checking in and I spent it running ill-optimized errands all over town. Despite being regional center and a university town, however, my dominant impression was one of incipient economic distress. The word that most often caught my eye was *available*. Available retail, office, apartment units, lots. What I saw less of was the *help wanted* so common in my hometown of Seattle, where low wage workers are being pushed further and further out by the cost of rental housing (home ownership is becoming monopolized by DINKs converting to child rearing years, and has gone through the proverbial roof). There's no apparent shortage of low-wage labor here.

Another puzzle is how little Tucson, compared to New Mexico, takes advantage of alternative energy. Perhaps the wind patterns aren't so reliable, but the solar in new construction is much less noticeable than it was in New Mexico or even Montana. 

Today, it was officially 107ÂºF, although my car had it higher, since it senses the pavement. Between water, energy and cooling, you have to wonder how ready Tucson might be for even small changes that change the conditions that govern those necessities.

I feel like the DoDah Man. It's good to travel the familiar exotic from time to time to realize that we have all had a long, strange trip.
