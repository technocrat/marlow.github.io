> We now have roses on the land and lilies on the water,— both land and water have done their best,— now just after the longest day. Nature says, “You behold the utmost I can do.” And the young women carry their finest roses on the other hand. Roses and lilies. The floral days. The highest, intensest color belongs to the land, the purest, perchance, to the water.

Thoreau, *Journal* Jun. 26, 1854
