I have been dabbling in the hipster lanaguage Lua, which you have to be cool even to have heard about. Its claim to fame is minimalism. It has one data type, called a table and I found myself wanting to combine two or more of them Ã  la cat (concatenate). WTF, there is no built-in way to do this? Incredulity began to lift when I discovered that neither was there a built-in way to even print tables. As a public service for the benefit of other pilgrims, here is

       --cat.lua concatenate tables
        function cat( ... ) -- append 1D tables
            local List = require 'pl.List' -- penlight library
            local args = {...}
            local l = List()
            for i=1, #args do
                l:extend(args[i])
            end
            return l
        end
        --[[Example
        a = {
            "gala",
            "cameo",
            "jazz"
        }
        o = {
            "seville",
            "valencia",
            "navel"
        }
        g = {
            "concord",
            "thompson",
            "muscat"
        }
        f = cat(a,o,g)
        {gala,cameo,jazz,seville,valencia,navel,concord,thompson,muscat}
