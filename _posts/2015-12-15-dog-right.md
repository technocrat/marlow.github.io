title: Dogs in the Fight

Several months back, I remarked to a friend regarding Daesh **we don't have a dog in this fight.**

**I was wrong.** We **do** have dogs in this fight. Too many.

> Once upon a time there was such a severe drought that all streams of water and all lakes were dried up. In this emergency the beasts assembled together to devise means to procure water. It was proposed by one to dig a well. All agreed to do so except the hare. She refused because it would soil her tiny paws. The rest, however, dug their well and were fortunate enough to find water. The hare beginning to suffer and thirst, and having no right to the well, was thrown upon her wits to procure water. She determined, as the easiest way, to steal from the public well. The rest of the animals, surprised to find that the hare was so well supplied with water, asked her where she got it. She replied that she arose betimes in the morning and gathered the dewdrops. However the wolf and the fox suspected her of theft and hit on the following plan to detect her:

> They made a wolf of tar and placed it near the well. On the following night the hare came as usual after her supply of water. On seeing the tar wolf she demanded who was there. Receiving no answer she repeated the demand, threatening to kick the wolf if he did not reply. She receiving no reply kicked the wolf, and by this means adhered to the tar and was caught. When the fox and wolf got hold of her they consulted what it was best to do with her. One proposed cutting her head off. This the hare protested would be useless, as it had often been tried without hurting her. Other methods were proposed for dispatching her, all of which she said would be useless. At last it was proposed to let her loose to perish in a thicket. Upon this the hare affected great uneasiness and pleaded hard for life. Her enemies, however, refused to listen and she was accordingly let loose. As soon, however, as she was out of reach of her enemies she gave a whoop, and bounding away she exclaimed: "This is where I live."--Cherokee Advocate, December 18, 1845.

I'll leave it to the philosophers to debate who should be assigned which roles in our current mess. But we'll do well to come off as easily as the hare.

Our client states in this cluster arrangement are NATO, collectively and individually, Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Poland and Turkey, Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia plus and minus a constellation of the minor gulf states, factions in Iraq and Afghanistan and Pakistan. On the periphery, as far as US interests are concerned are Somalia, Kenya, Nigeria, Mali, Sudan, South Sudan and parts of other states in Africa that don't regularly make the news.

The center of attention, currently, is the anti-state of Daesh. Here I'm following Henry Kissinger's analysis in *World Order* in which he discusses the critique of the notion of nation state as an illegitimate secular institution that found its modern proponent in Sayyid Qutb with adherents across a sectarian spectrum in Islam. As an oversimplification, let's consider the incumbent extremist version, because they are not unopposed by regional parties who have some sympathy for the philosophical position but have centuries-old bitter divisions on what a legitimate *non-secular* version of society consists.[^wilson]

For a Manichean start let's put the US and Daesh as the poles of good and evil.

This is the bipolar world we know and love. The *High Noon* showdown, may the best man win. *We'll see your AK-47 and raise you a B-52.*

The world we actually live in, however, differs.

Let's see if we can sort this out. Here's a highly simplified portrayal of the players.

*Radical Islam* as a concept does not do much to sort this all out anymore than the idea of *Crusading Christians* in opposition. The differences within each are much more relevant than the commonalities. Sunni, Shia and variants, Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant and variants, Liberal, Conservative and Orthodox Judaism and variants -- these sectarian differences as a matter of religion divide as much as the unify, based not only on theological grounds but more to the point on political and tribal grounds.

Take for example the civil war in Northern Ireland. It was not **about** the finer points of Apolstolic succession. **It was *who's on top?*** Similarly, the reason the Southern Baptist Church split off had everything to do with *preserving our Southern way of life* and nothing to do with the hymnal. Pure us vs. them.

So let's cut through the bullshit and see who is in conflict with who else and see how that lines up with carpet bombing. Daesh isn't going to stop being a bad actor just because we might force it to change its tactics.

There are actually a number of interrelated conflicts going on. There's the free-for-all firefights, bomb-fests and up-close and personal barbarities in Syria itself. Starting with Assad, we have

OK. Now someone please tell me which one of the GOP candidates *shows* a clue that the Daesh problem might be more complex than the bombastic send in the boys (and girls) in uniform to set things right. I suspect that at least a few of them **do** have a clue, but none wants the fabled GOP Base (funny, the Arabic word for base is Al-Qaeda, actually) to suspect any possibility of grayness.


[^wilson]: Another time, perhaps, we can talk of the failure of the century-long experiment in Wilsonian democracy, in which the freely expressed will of the people organized by lanugage and culture was supposed to lead to peace and its more recent cousin, the neoliberalism project, that promised the same result from free market forces.
