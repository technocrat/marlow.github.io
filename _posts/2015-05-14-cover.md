>  It is one of the key features of early 21st century political campaigns and political life in general that every political figure requires a chorus of dedicated partisans who lay down the equivalent of covering fire in their leader's defense. Sometimes this happens with a political figure who attracts intense loyalty. But that's seldom required. Partisans on both sides of the political divide will generally rush to the defense of almost any political figure on their team, even if the person isn't terribly well liked or even if they're getting grief for something that is pretty hard to defend.
