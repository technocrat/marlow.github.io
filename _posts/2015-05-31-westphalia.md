> Far from marking the "end of imperialism", what we are witnessing today, a century after the implosion of the Ottoman empire, is its resurgence. In this new scramble for the Middle East, we are witnessing the petty sultans of the region's crumbling states trying to hold on to their micro-empires; non-state armed groups trying to usurp them; Iran and the emerging powers of the Gulf seeking to expand their spheres of influence; and the US' long-standing hegemony being challenged by the new-old kid on the block, Russia, and newcomer China.
