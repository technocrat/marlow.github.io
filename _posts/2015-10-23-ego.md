 > In the past I used to think, "The weaker your ego, the stronger you are." I thought that a strong ego was egoistical, self-obsessed and self-serving, and so I desired a meek, more spiritual ego that would better serve others. Relentlessly, I practiced until I crushed my ego so thin it was transparent, and then there was nothing to live for and no energy to serve anyone.

The greatest of all Rabbis throughout the ages is Akiva. When an illiterate peasant approached him one day and asked if he could condense the entire Tora to one simple sentence, Akiva replied: "Love your friend as much as you love yourself." If you dwell on this sentence for a second, you see that it suggests that the more you love yourself, the more you can love others. I reckon self-deprecation is very dangerous for the low-status person and that indeed humility in high-status people is a great virtue.
