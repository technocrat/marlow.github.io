Before it more widely became rude to use the adjective, I would have said that today was *Indian Summer* at its best. Bright, low raking light, blue sky, warm sun, cool breeze, greens growing old, the weak trees turning and the anticipation of change. We should borrow one of the synonmyms from others that capture the elegaic quality of these weeks.
