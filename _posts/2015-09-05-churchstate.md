<h2>School Prayer, the Conservative Case</h2>

<p>The difference between a reactionary and a conservative on the question of school prayer: the conservative wants to keep the State out of the Church&#39;s business, while the reactionary wants to inject the Church into the State&#39;s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There cannot be freedom of religion, safeguarded by the state, and intervention by the church or its agencies in the state&#39;s domain or dependency on its largesse... . The great condition of religious liberty is that it be maintained free from sustenance, as also from other interferences, by the state. For when it comes to rest upon that secular foundation it vanishes with the resting. </p>
