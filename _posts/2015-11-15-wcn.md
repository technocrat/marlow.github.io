It is easy to see ¿Jeb✝! and The Donald™ as representing polar opposites of The Establishment vs. Insurgent Populists. But that obscures what they have in common -- they each reveal their real thoughts and feelings spontaneously. One does so on purpose and the other can't seem to help it. In one case, the candidate's whole schtick is shooting from the hip, making it up as he goes along and convincing himself in the process. In the other, it seems to be a hereditary inability to keep on message when matters of core believe conflict.

> We should focus our efforts as it relates to refugees on the Christians that are being slaughtered

[WaPo]

Unlike other candidates who have suggested allowing no refugees from the region at all, the scion of the compassionate conversative family would make an exception for Christians. Perhaps, even, if the chaos began to engulf Israel and displace Jews he might make another concession in their case. But no Muslims, because among their number might be terrorists. The Muslims who are terrorists will have to content themselves with entering the US with a visitor visa, which will require an interview for those over 13 and under 80. As of today, there is a waiting time for an interview at most consultates. Currently, for Beruit, its 12 days. 

As a factor in picking those whose suffering should be relieved, it seems to help if they have familar faces.

This is in keeping with historical US precedent

> Which leads me to add one remark: That the number of purely white people in the world is proportionably very small. All Africa is black or tawny. Asia chiefly tawny. America (exclusive of the new comers) wholly so. And in Europe, the Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians and Swedes are generally of what we call a swarthy complexion; as are the Germans also, the Saxons only excepted, who with the English make the principal body of white people on the face of the earth. I could wish their numbers were increased. And while we are, as I may call it, scouring our planet, by clearing America of woods, and so making this side of our globe reflect a brighter light to the eyes of inhabitants in Mars or Venus, why should we in the sight of superior beings, darken its people? Why increase the sons of Africa, by planting them in America, where we have so fair an opportunity, by excluding all blacks and tawneys, of increasing the lovely white and red? But perhaps I am partial to the complexion of my Country, for such kind of partiality is natural to Mankind.

[Observations], 1755

The 2016 election echos the fears 1755 long after the black and the tawny of the globe have come to America, helped build and defend it, raised families unto the fifth generation and beyond and interchanged DNA beyond all unscrambling. If America ever *was* a "white, Christian nation" in the unlovely language of white supremacy, it is not now and has not been in the lifetime of any but centenarians, if even them.

*Make them speak English, make them leave behind all that is unAmerican, make them prove themselves to be just like us* is the forlorn prayer of the *reasonable* converative. And, indeed, we have a strong cultural influence and those who settle here become more like us, but never so much as to avoid the real problem, **we become more like them**.
