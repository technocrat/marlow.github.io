Lying in bed with aching joints and a fever,

wracking up plugs of phlegm,

the patient suffers the annual spring chest cold

As the voice descends to the lower register,

so does the normal awareness of time,Â 

like Einstein's traveler

Whatever it was, last week or next, will have to wait

The faint cares of taxes and insurance pass through brief notice

Vague ambition to re-read, again, the page of the open book

arises and likewise fades
