[The Section 215 Wrecking Ball - The New Yorker](http://nyr.kr/1KRZVnH)

> Congress, of course, has been known to do nothing. Rampant game-theorizing joined with senatorial incompetence may mean that June 1st will come and nothing will be done. If there is one thing that the Senate is adept at, it’s missing deadlines. This is a hard one to hide from, though, even for these legislators. We’re used to asking whether Congress matters; in this case, the question here is whether Congress’s laws matter, either. If they don’t, we’re not left with much in Washington but a wrecking ball.
