> This shared property, the meaning (of the two sentences in their respective languages), or the content (of the beliefs they express), is a central topic in philosophy and cognitive science. This aboutness that, for example, sentences, pictures, beliefs, and (no doubt) some brain states exhibit, is known in philosophical jargon as intentionality , an unfortunate choice as a technical term, since outsiders routinely confuse it with the everyday idea of doing something intentionally (as in “Are your intentions honorable?”).
