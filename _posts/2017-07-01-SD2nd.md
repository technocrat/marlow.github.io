Wall is every railroad induced town in the Great Plains. You don't even need to see the tracks to understand the reason this town exists. Just take a look through the light rain at the elevators.

But, it is famous for two other reasons: it's the turnoff for the Badlands National Park and Wall's Drug.

There actually *is* a drug store buried within this Venus flytrap for tourists, along with a museum piece of the days when it *was* just a drugstore. But today, it's a mini-mall of souvenirs running from penny stamping machines, to genuine local cowboy lariats, Luchese boots, and an endless variety of things to appeal to every possible customer that walks into the arcade.

You may never have been there, but chances are you've heard of it. I can't help but imagine old man Trump packing the family, including young Donny, into the family rail car to go out west to see the sights. Thus, was implanted into the future President's reptilian brain the effectiveness of sheer ubiquity. Subliminally, you've passed the cars with *Where the hell is Wall, South Dakota?* bumper stickers. Liminally, for 50 miles in every direction, you are bombarded with corny billboards (probably carefully designed by Saatchi and Saatchi) making different pitches. Ice cream. World's largest. Famous. Unique. You name it.

Undoubtedly, Wall Drug is responsible for accelerating the arrival of fiber optic.

The hanger on joints are also unapologetically corny

I had dinner across the street at a poster-child western steakhouse. I began by saluting the wildlife I saw the day before, with a shot of Wild Turkey

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-WildTurkey.png)

and having a ribeye steak with mashed potatoes (served, unbidden, in a sea of salty dark brown gravy). The steak was chewy and had far more flavor than the tenderized fare of urban power dinner expense account competitors..

I walked back to the motel to find it bathed in Golden Hour light.

(Thats 5,400ÂºK for you STEM types. Why I remember this factoid is unexplained.)

The next morning, fortified by the breakfast equivalent of school lunch at the Best Western, I set off for the nearby entrance to the Badlands. As a teaser, everyone slowed to watch a family meal by the roadside

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-RoadSide.png)

The first good look is pretty dramatic.

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-Vista.png)

My immediate thought was *nothing good could come from attempting to find a path through this.*

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-NoExit.png)

Fortunately, the nice rangers had provided some paths within it.

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-Trailhead.png)

After consulting the unusually scant handout and trail map, I settled on the Castle Trail and set off to see the wonders.

The first thing I noticed was the sheer parchedness of the place.

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-MudFlat.png)

Then I got the creepies. The Badlands are *fractal*. Without a point of reference, it's hard to tell whether you are looking from a distance or up close.

Grand Canyon?

Near or far?

Big Bend?

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-LittleErosion.png)

Oh my god, am I here all alone?

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-Alone.png)

Is this the Hole in the Wall where Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid planned their next exploit?

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-HoleInTheWall.png)

Is that a rattlesnake hole or the entrance to a cavern?

Although helpful marker posts were provided, it was sometimes hard to make out the trail and you have to make like a guide reading spoor.

I saw darker foot shaped areas that looked like a group had crossed in the rain.

I was unsure which outcropping the Castle Trail was named after, but this one is a pretty fair impression of the pyramid south of Cairo at Saqqara, predating the famous stone faced examples a millenium plus later.

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-Saqqara.png)

A short while later I start to cross yet another decissated flat area, but this one is covered in cobbles. Western South Dakota was not glaciated in the Pleistocene, so these are not glacial erratics. A close squint reveal them to be, like the rock making up the Badlands, volcanic, but coarser grain and *much, much more resistant* to erosion, like this 6-inch piece of quartz.

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-QuartzErratic.png)

There's not much growing on the soft volcanic rock aside from prickly pear

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-PricklyPear.png)

except on the verge of the prarie.

Abruptly, I have to play trivial pursuit (Latin, *tri via*, three roads)

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-TriVia.png)

and decide whether to go back the way I came, continue on to the end of Castle Trail and face the practical necessity of hitchhiking the 10-miles back to where I parked (I'd gone only 2 miles in the hour I was out, and it was another 3 miles to the trail end) or tackling the Saddle Pass trail, which is short, but steep. Really steep. But after all the quad work some hamstring action wouldn't be out of order, down I go, after helping three incoming hikers up over the final 4 foot cliff (nice of me, I know).

I'm a Leo but for the next 500 feet of elevation and 15 minutes, I became a Cancer, taking crabwise steps to avoid sliding on my butt (so undignified, although once or twice I considered it). At the bottom, I was rewarded with a miniature table rock

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-TableRock.png)

and the end of my trail,

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-Return.png)

when it began to rain

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-Squall.png)

Nothing for it but to begin the long back trudge to the car.

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-BackTrudge.png)

Knowing that I had lost at least 500 feet in elevation, I wondered when the level road would start to climb. The answer? The best for last.

All together it was 2 1/2 hours and 9 miles and, on reflection, a much more interesting hike than the one around Devil's Tower.

Rather than continue the loop back to the interstate, I took the first exit into the little town of Interior, because I had developed an appetite and felt I had earned a beer, damn it!

There were two bars in town. The first one was closed, and I didn't qualify.

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-InteriorBar1.png)

The second was open,

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tuva/2017-06-29-InteriorDiveBar.png)

and I stepped in, had a Negro Modelo (no local drafts) and listen to the ranchers who'd just finished haying a field order double Crown Royals and gossip about the other 70 people who lived in town, their fortunes and misfortunes, the price of beef, the weather and all the other data that determine economic life or death in this part of the world.

From there, I decided to press eastward along rural roads toward Omaha. With the last of my connectivity, I made a reservation in Winner, South Dakota (they got the train stop) and drove past fields of freshly mown and baled hay, thinking of Wallace Stegner's ^[book] *Beyond the Hundredth Meridian*, a cautionary tale of the battle in the 19th century between the science of John Wesley Powell, the one-armed topographer who mapped huge swaths of the West and the agricultural Babbits who were sure that the rain would follow the plow past the longitude where rainfall averages less than 20 inches per year. It didn't and you can see it by the almost complete lack of field crops as you proceed east. What few patches of corn you see will be knee high by the fourth of July, but only if you are 3-feet tall.

Flying over this country is an exercise in geometric abstraction. Driving the interstate cuts through back yards. The rural highways pass the front yards, but the place remains of its own, tenacious and unwelcoming, suspended in time and place indefinitely.

On to Omaha, KC, then southing and westing ad lib.
