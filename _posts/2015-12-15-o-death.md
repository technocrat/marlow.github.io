The salt, on the ready tongue, quickens the pulse,  
They say, to its untimely end as the quickened   
Beats run out the days left to breath and then  
Cease their busy news of the never changing  
Day to cease, to still, to be no thing, nothing  
And then the sea-salt blood returns to earth  
To ash and await the day long to come that  
It renews the beat without the thought
