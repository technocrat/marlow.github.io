title: The Seven Pillars of Data Wisdom
tags: analysis
---	
1.   Statistical functions produce measures, not analyses
     * Being able to produce a measure or graph a function is not the same as understanding the result.
     * See perennial best-seller *How to Lie with Statistics*
     * It's even easy to fool yourself
     * Don't assume that the data at hand necessarily is all you should be looking at.
     * GIGO
   
2.  Exploratory Data Analysis
     * What the data *can* tell us
     * Finding the right ballpark
     * Quick and dirty but approximately right beats exactly wrong
     * Teasing out the *right* questions
    
3. Confirmatory Data Analysis
     * What is the theory that the data are supposed to test?
     * The null hypothesis and negative proof
     * Finding the right statistical tool
     * Interpreting the result
     
4.  Survey of Tests
     * Parametric
     * Non-parametric

5.   From Tests to Models
     * Parsimony as a guiding principle
     * Types of predictive modelling
     * Dangers of overfitting
     * Sensitivity, edge cases, game changers and other qualifiers
     
6.  Reproducibility
     * Checklists
     * Standardized reports
     * Version control
     * Data snapshots
     * Seeding
     
7. Presentation
     * Underselling as career insurance
     * Balance between bottom lines and supporting detail
     * Importance of visualization
     * Keeping the gory details to technical appendices
     * Confronting "so what?"
