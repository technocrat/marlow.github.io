I walked around a bit more in Rapid City, which has a downtown bigger than my hometown with, frankly, a fair amount of civic pride -- lots of flowers, a statue of a President on every corner and sort of mini-REI, where I picked up a few missing items that I didn't have room for.

I had a lunch with a glass of local beer. I passed on the wine.

I then headed out of town to Mt. Rushmore, which *is* imposing.

I didn't see Cary Grant, Eve Marie Saint or Martin Landau or hear the velvet tones of James Mason (YACIJ: yet another cinematic injoke), but I did see everyone else.

For, you see, Mt. Rushmore is America's socialized Disneyland. Dress for success triumphal architecture, of the kind favored by Al Speer, frames the holy procession to the annointed Great Ones (at least three of whom *were* pretty great).

There's ice cream in honor of the men and women who worked to realize the artists vision,

including relatives, possibly, of my step-sister Jan.

The paths are broad and paved and there's something for everyone, as in this unfortunately named facility.

The spoil pile from removing 450,000 tons of rock is impressive,

and required three little stationary steam engines that could

produce the compressed air to drive the drills to pack with dynamite.

There's no entry fee, you just pay a concessionaire to park. There *is* however, indication of classified government involvement (YACIJ)

On the way in and back out is one of the largest concentration of tourist traps I have ever seen. Images cannot do justice to the assault on attention. The mildest stretch is closest to the entrance

but has an unusual feature. The DQ is crewed by foreign students. I was served by a young man who had a little trouble making change for my cone. He said he was from Mongolia and we had a lively discussion of Tem√ºjin.

From there I bypassed Rapid City, cruised by Sturgis, grateful to miss the annual pilgrimage, and got to Wall, home of Wall Drugs, of which more next time.
