This blog is the cure for the common cold. It will never go viral. It is primarily intended for my own recall.

The editorial *I* am Richard Careaga, husband of M.A. Mariner, father of Mark Careaga and the recently made eldest of his line. I am @technocrat on github and [twitter]. I pontificate at [Quora]. On tumblr, I am [passletongue]. I'm on FB, but not much. If I think of others, I'll add them.

Any ads you see here don't come through me.
